# NeetCode 150 Challenge

Welcome to my **NeetCode 150 Challenge** repository! 🎯  

This repository is dedicated to solving the popular **NeetCode 150** problems for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. I am taking this challenge to improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of DSA concepts, and prepare for coding interviews.

---

## 📚 About the Challenge

The **NeetCode 150** is a well-curated list of **150 essential coding problems** that cover a wide range of topics:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- And more...

By solving these problems, I'll:
- Develop a solid foundation in DSA.
- Strengthen my coding interview preparation.
- Gain confidence in tackling real-world problems.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

```
.
├── Questions/        # Problem statements and input images
├── Solution/         # My implementations for each problem
```

### File Naming
- Each solution is implemented in Java and named after the problem (e.g., `TwoSum.java`, `ValidAnagram.java`).
- Optimized versions of solutions (if applicable) are included with descriptive names (e.g., `DuplicateOptimized.java`).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VSCode
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Solve all **150 problems** by tackling one problem daily (or more).
- Write optimized and clean code for each problem.
- Document the thought process for each solution.
